# Predicting mushroom edibility using classification models

!!! abstract ""
    :fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation: **Problem:** I wanted to predict whether a mushroom is edible using its physical characteristics.

    :material-lightbulb-on-10: **Solution:** I trained several binary classification models (logistic regression, random forest, boosting, k-NN, and neural network) to predict mushroom edibility. I used F-score and AUC to compare the models. I also used logistic regression to identify the most useful predictors.

    :octicons-graph-16: **Results:** The best models were k-NN and neural network, which both achieved a perfect 1.0 (perfect) F-score and a 1.0 (perfect) AUC. The most useful predictors were gill size, bruises, and gill spacing.
